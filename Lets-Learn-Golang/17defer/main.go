// Description:
// A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
// Defer is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a programâ€™s execution,
// usually for purposes of cleanup. defer is often used where e.g. ensure and finally would be used in other languages.
// LIFO order (last-in-first-out): the last deferred function is executed first.
