<!-- Memory Management In Golang -->

## Memory Management In Golang
Memory management is the process of allocating new objects and removing unused objects to make space for new incoming objects. In languages like C, C++, and Java, memory management is done manually by the programmer. In languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, memory management is done automatically by the language itself.

In Golang, memory management is done automatically by the language itself. Golang uses a garbage collector to manage memory. The garbage collector runs in its own goroutine. It is responsible for freeing up memory that is no longer being used by the program. The garbage collector is a part of the runtime environment.

### Stack and Heap
In Golang, memory is divided into two parts: stack and heap. The stack is used to store the local variables and is used for static memory allocation and deallocation. The heap is used to store the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. The heap is managed by the garbage collector.

### Garbage Collection Algorithm
The garbage collector uses a mark and sweep algorithm to free up memory. The mark and sweep algorithm is a two-step process. In the first step, the garbage collector marks all the objects that are still being used by the program. In the second step, the garbage collector sweeps through the heap and frees up all the objects that are no longer being used by the program.
